                    digital field recording. Known for his meticulous approach, he combines traditional excavation 
                    techniques with modern 3D scanning. At the Museum of Jade Studies, he curates the ancient jade 
                    collection and supervises field research. Dr. Li Wei is an award-winning researcher, having received 
                    the Young Archaeologist Fellowship for his innovative analysis of jade tool production.

                    Dr. Mei Chen earned her PhD in Physical Anthropology from the University of Hong Kong, studying 
                    osteology and ancient burial practices. She has analyzed skeletal remains from multiple jade-rich 
                    tombs, interpreting mortuary rituals and health conditions. Dr. Chen is skilled in CT scanning, 
                    isotopic analysis, and 3D bone reconstruction. She is detail-oriented and highly intuitive, often 
                    identifying patterns others overlook. At the Museum of Jade Studies, she researches anthropological 
                    traces and collaborates with the archaeological team to contextualize human activity. She has

                <h3>Interpretive Discipline</h3>
                <p class="bio-expertise">Cultural Historian and Community Storyweaver</p>
                <h3>Professional Bio</h3>
                <p>
                    Alex Tan holds a Master’s degree in Cultural History from the National University of Singapore and 
                    specializes in translating archaeological and anthropological evidence into engaging public 
                    narratives. Fascinated by the symbolism and ritual use of jade, he connects artifacts to social 
                    structures, belief systems, and daily life. Alex employs ethnographic interviews, archival research, 
                    and AI-assisted modeling to create immersive museum exhibits. At the Museum of Jade Studies, he 
                    develops interpretive content, signage, and interactive tours that help visitors engage deeply with 
                    the collection. A skeptic and a dreamer, Alex balances rigorous research with imaginative 
                    storytelling.

                <p>
                    Combines field data, interviews, and historical texts, collaborating closely with designers and 
                    artists to create engaging multimedia exhibits. Leverages AI tools to visualize past rituals in a 
                    culturally respectful and immersive manner.
                </p>
                <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    Ensures exhibits reflect authentic cultural perspectives and highlights overlooked narratives. 
                    Challenges assumptions and encourages critical engagement with history.
